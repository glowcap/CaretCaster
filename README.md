### The best podcast app that's not yet available

When it comes to listening to podcasts, there are lots of options. Even though they are all greate, they're each missing that one thing that could make them great. **Caret Caster** is my way to fix that.

This application is under development. Public access is for potential clients to get an insight on my code. There's still a ton to do, so feel free to follow along.
