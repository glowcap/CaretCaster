      "description": "Now more than ever, it's important to look boldly at the reality of race and gender bias -- and understand how the two can combine to create even more harm. Kimberlé Crenshaw uses the term \"intersectionality\" to describe this phenomenon; as she says, if you're standing in the path of multiple forms of exclusion, you're likely to get hit by both. In this moving talk, she calls on us to bear witness to this reality and speak up for victims of prejudice.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TEDTalks_audio/~4/Y1B8kMkrC3o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",

      "description": "On February 10, 2015, Suzanne Barakat's brother Deah, her sister-in-law Yusor and Yusor's sister Razan were murdered by their neighbor in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The perpetrator's story, that he killed them over a traffic dispute, went unquestioned by the media and police until Barakat spoke out at a press conference, calling the murders what they really were: hate crimes. As she reflects on how she and her family reclaimed control of their narrative, Barakat calls on us to speak up when we witness hateful bigotry and express our allyship with those who face discrimination.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TEDTalks_audio/~4/OoWrXaSMTgU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>",
